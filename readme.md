# Querying similar videos from a Video Database

## Overview
The goal of the project is to create a indexed videos database and also a platform to search and retrieve videos similar to the query video. This is accomplished by utilizing three attributes of the video

* CNN embeddings of the video keyframes
* RBG distributions of the video keyframes
* Audio embedding of the video

## Keyframe extraction

## CNN embeddings

## RGB Distribution

## Audio embeddings 

## Similarity meausure

## Result
